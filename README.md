# todolist-app

## This app consists of a Homepage (used for Login/Register) and a Dashboard.


- # HomePage 


![Register](https://github.com/aswnrj/todolist-app/blob/master/ToDoList%20App/images/register.png)

The homepage has a Register form and Sign Up with Google/Facebook buttons.

![Login](https://github.com/aswnrj/todolist-app/blob/master/ToDoList%20App/images/login.png)

The login page can be used to login after signing up.

**The Google and Facebook sign in buttons are _not functional_ as of now.**

- # Dashboard

Once logged in, the dashboard helps to keep track of the to-do items. The add, and move functionality is available once it is connected to a mongodb database.

![Dashboard4](https://github.com/aswnrj/todolist-app/blob/master/ToDoList%20App/images/dashboard4.png)

The frontend is created purely using HTML/CSS along with Bootstrap and also EJS. 
The backend is created using NodeJS along with Express.
Mongoose is used to connect to the local MongoDB database.

**As of now, only one user can login at a time and this webapp is neither hosted on any server or linked to any cloud database.
I am also planning to add authentication using "passport" and also OAuth.**

Feel free to fork this repo and add changes.
